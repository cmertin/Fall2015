\section*{General Instructions}

{\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
  \item You are welcome to talk to other members of the class about
    the homework. I am more concerned that you understand the
    underlying concepts. However, you should write down your own
    solution. Please keep the class collaboration policy in mind.

  \item Feel free ask the instructor or the TAs questions about the
    homework.

  \item Your written solutions should be brief and clear. You need to
    show your work, not just the final answer, but you do \emph{not}
    need to write it in glory detail. Your assignment should be {\bf no
      more than 10 pages}. Every extra page will cost a point.

  \item Handwritten solutions will not be accepted.

  \item The homework is due by midnight of the due date. Please submit
    the homework on Canvas.

  \end{itemize}

{\large\bf Notation}

It is important that I define two different notations that are used in this homework assignment. I used this notation to make the math work easier, though my final results I remove this notation

{\bf Einstein Summation Notation}

This simply removes the sum as the sum is \underline{understood} for the context of the problem. Example:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \zeta_{i} = \zeta_{i}
\]

{\bf Mertin Product Notation}

This removes the product symbol infront of some terms as it is \underline{understood} from the context of the problem. I made a variation to make it different when compared to {\em Einstein Summation Notation} so you can tell the difference (note the tilde)

\[
\prod_{i=1}^{n}\zeta_{i} = \utilde{\zeta_{i}}
\]
