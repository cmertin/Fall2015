</ol>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p><a name="prerequisites"></a></p>

<p>Students are expected to be familiar with:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Basic probability theory and statistics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Linear algebra</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Computer science skills to be able to understand and reason about
algorithms and implement them</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, we will introduce some of the relevant prerequisite
concepts in the lectures as needed, but knowing the topics will
significantly help in understanding the new material.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p><a name="grading"></a></p>

<p>The grades for the course will be based on 5-6 assignments, one or two
quizzes, two exams and a project. The different components will be
weighted as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assignments and quizzes: 36%</li>
  <li>Midterm exam: 20%</li>
  <li>Final exam: 20%</li>
  <li><a href="projects.html">Project</a>: 24%</li>
</ul>

<p>Undergraduate and graduate students will be separately curved. Some
assignments and exams may include extra problems only for the graduate
students.</p>

<p>Your assignments must be submitted electronically on Canvas by
<em>midnight</em> of the due date. Detailed instructions for submission will
accompany each assignment. <em>Hand written assignments or printouts will
not be accepted.</em></p>

<h4 id="instructions-for-programming-assignments">Instructions for programming assignments</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You may use any programming language for the programming portions
of your assignments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, your program <em>must</em> compile and run on the
<a href="http://www.cade.utah.edu/">CADE</a> machines. You will receive no
credit for programs that don’t run on the CADE machines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your submission should include a <code>readme.txt</code> file that gives
instructions for how to run your code. A submission that does not
include a readme file will not be executed by the TAs or the
instructor and you will receive no credit for that submission.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="late-policy">Late policy</h4>

<p>All assignments must be submitted by the deadline. We will use the
timestamp on Canvas as the submission time. Assignments will be
accepted up to 24 hours after deadline, but will be assessed a 10%
penalty. That is, if your assignment is late and scores 90, then your
actual grade will be 81 = 90 - 9. Assignments will <em>not</em> be accepted
24 hours after the deadline.</p>

<p>We will be strict about this policy: If the deadline is midnight and
you submit the assignment at 12:01 AM, you will face the 10% penalty!</p>

<h4 id="no-double-dipping-projects-across-multiple-classes">No double dipping projects across multiple classes</h4>

<p>You can not submit the same project to this class and another class
that you may be taking at the same time. If you are doing related
projects in two different classes, there may be some overlap (e.g. in
code libraries, etc.), but they should not be identical. A project
that is found to be double-submitted will receive <em>zero</em> credit. If
you have questions about this policy, please contact the instructor.</p>

<h3 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h3>
<p><a name="course-policies"></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaboration and cheating</strong>: Collaboration is encouraged;
cheating will not be tolerated.</p>

    <p><em>Important</em>: The class operates under the School of Computing’s
<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/misc/cheating_policy.pdf">policy on academic misconduct</a>.
Students should read it and, if you haven’t done so already, sign the
<a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/misc/SoC_ack_form.pdff">acknowledgment form</a>
within two weeks of the start of the semester.</p>

    <p><strong><u>Honor code for this class</u></strong></p>

    <p>You are encouraged to discuss class materials with your peers. If
you want you could form study groups because discussions help
understanding. You are also welcome to discuss assignments. However,
you must write your own solutions, proofs and code and submit your
own solution. Do not copy or ask for assignments from other students
or the internet. Do not let someone else copy your submissions
either. If you are caught cheating once, you <em>will</em> receive a
failing grade for that submission. If you are caught cheating again,
you will fail the class.</p>

    <p>For projects, you are free to discuss the project with anyone in your
project group.</p>

    <p>For both assignments and projects, please cite all sources that you
refer to. This includes personal communication, books, papers,
websites, etc. Doing so reflects academic integrity.</p>

    <p>For the exams, of course, we will allow neither collaboration nor
cheating!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Students with disabilities</strong>: The University of Utah seeks to
provide equal access to its programs, services and activities for
people with disabilities. Please let me know as soon as possible. If
you wish to qualify for exemptions under the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), you should also notify the
<a href="http://disability.utah.edu/">Center for Disability Services</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also see the
<a href="http://www.coe.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/pdf/faculty/semester_guidelines.pdf">College of Engineering guidelines</a>
for information about appeals, the Americans with Disabilities Act,
repeating courses and add and withdraw deadlines.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="communication-with-teaching-staff">Communication with Teaching Staff</h3>
<p><a name="communication"></a></p>

<p>We strongly encourage you to post your questions on the
<a href="https://utah.instructure.com/courses/341560/discussion_topics">class discussion board on Canvas</a>,
unless you have a question that you wish to keep confidential. The
instructor and the TAs will monitor the forum and will answer
questions. Other students may also be able to answer questions on
Canvas.</p>

<p>For grading questions, project related issues or simply a more
hands-on interaction, we encourage you to attend the office hours or
meet the instructor/TAs after class.</p>

<p>Of course, for personal/private questions, do feel free contact the
instructor or the TAs by email or in person.</p>
